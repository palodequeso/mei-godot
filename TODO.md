# TODO - MEI-Godot

### Viewer Polish
- [ ] Better system view camera placement - start at interesting viewpoint, not arbitrary offset

### VR Improvements
- [ ] menu work - The VR menu needs to be fully reworked and implemented
- [ ] Hand interaction polish - better grab/point interactions
- [ ] Haptic feedback for selections
- [ ] Comfort options (vignette, snap turn)
- [ ] Mobile VR testing (Quest standalone)

### Visual Improvements
- [ ] Planet texture assignment based on planet type (not random)
- [ ] Procedural planet textures or shader-based rendering
- [ ] Orbital motion - planets actually move over time
- [ ] Better asteroid belt rendering (individual asteroids at close range)
- [ ] LOD system for stars (larger points when closer)
- [ ] Planet atmospheres
- [ ] Planet weather
- [ ] Planet day/night cycles

### UI/UX
- [ ] Bookmark/favorite system for stars and positions
- [ ] Search functionality (by star ID or coordinates)
- [ ] Screenshot/video capture
- [ ] Better tooltips and help text
- [ ] Settings persistence

## Future Ideas

### Features
- [ ] Multiple galaxy support (galaxy clusters)
- [ ] Time controls (speed up/slow down orbital motion)
- [ ] Measurement tools (distance between stars)
- [ ] Export star/system data to JSON

### Rendering
- [ ] Nebula rendering
- [ ] Black hole visualization at galactic center
- [ ] Comet trails
- [ ] Ring systems for gas giants

### Integration
- [ ] Multiplayer support (shared exploration)
- [ ] Save/load favorite galaxies
- [ ] Custom galaxy parameters UI

## Technical Debt

- [ ] Clean up GDScript warnings
- [ ] Better error handling in GDExtension bindings
- [ ] Unit tests for GDScript logic
- [ ] Document GDExtension API for other Godot developers
